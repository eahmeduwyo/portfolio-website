**Acknowledgments & Sources**



Most of the content and project data were sourced from:



My personal website – estiakahmed.com, originally developed using WordPress with a PHP backend



My LinkedIn profile – for educational, professional, and project references



ChatGPT-4 – for generating descriptive sections such as the About Me content



W3Schools – for references on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript syntax and best practices



The project structure and some dynamic coding logic (especially JSON/XML + DOM integration) were developed with the help of ChatGPT-4o.



Due to my previous experience with web development, certain features may go beyond the standard scope of class materials.
